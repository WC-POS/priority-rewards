## What is it?
---
Priority Rewards is a simple loyalty application developed from the ground up for [FuturePOS](https://futurepos.com) users and customers. The goal is create more engagement between restaurants and their customers, promoting healthier, more mutually beneficial relationships that can sustainably survive for years.

*Note:* Before running any component script, ensure that [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) is running within the root directory. All of the components rely on subdomains that are only accessible during local development via caddy reverse proxies.

**Start Caddy Server**
```bash
caddy
```

## Compoments

### 游릭 API
A Fastify web service connected to MongoDB using the fantastic Mongoose package. Of course, TypeScript is the 
main language of choice 游뗿游낗 Admin and authentication functions are handled through REST endpoints, while the applications work through GraphQL channels.

**Current Feature Tasks**
- [ ] Finish Admin Account routes for Admin portal management
- [ ] Build Various Promotion models
- [ ] Add GraphQL and scope for regular account use only
- [ ] Add Phone Based Auth service for regular accounts

**Start API Server**
```bash
cd ./api 
yarn dev
```

*Additional Notes*
- Ensure that MongoDB server is running
- Use Docker for local development
- Credentials should be specified in root .env file

### 游릭 Progressive Web Applicaiton
A NextJS project communicating via GraphQL to the API service. Again, we're leveraging TS here and using utilty first CSS via [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

The design can be viewed in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/R89KHdc7KUjriFYtaa1fVV/PriorityRewards?node-id=0%3A1)

**Current Feature Tasks**
- [ ] Generate project
- [ ] Complete phone based Auth workflow

**Start PWA Server**
```bash
cd ./app
yarn dev
```

---

### 游릭 Admin Web Applicaiton
Another NextJS project, currently in JS, but shortly being moved to TS. Styling and components are built using [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/). Most of the actions performed here are done via the API REST endpoints.

**Start Admin Server**
```bash
cd ./admin
yarn dev
```

---

### 游릭 Local Sync Application
Electron application for connecting the FPOS MSSQL DB to PriorityRewards cloud servers via generated API keys and a variety of API REST endpoints. Work is done in TS and based on the [ERB](https://electron-react-boilerplate.js.org/) template. For easy and safe DB functions, [TypeORM](https://typeorm.io/#/) is used for connecting to the FPOS DB.

**Start Development Application**
```bash
cd ./sync
yarn dev
```

**Generate TypeORM FPOS Models**
```bash
npx typeorm-model-generator
# This is done in interactive mode
# This may also take up to or even longer than ~20 minutes, the FPOS DB setup is large and complex
```

*Note:* Binary/native packages from npm must be installed to the applications secondary package.json found at ./sync/release/app/package.json.
